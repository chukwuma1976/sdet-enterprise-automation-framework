# 🚀 Enterprise Test Automation Framework
![CI Pipeline](https://github.com/chukwuma1976/sdet-enterprise-automation-framework/actions/workflows/ci-pipeline.yml/badge.svg)

## Playwright (Java) | Selenium | RestAssured | JUnit 5 | CI/CD | Parallel-Ready

A production-style UI test automation framework built with **Java + Playwright** designed for **scalability, determinism, and CI reliability.**

This project demonstrates how enterprise SDET teams architect automation frameworks — focusing on lifecycle control, isolation, parallel execution, and flakiness mitigation.

# 🧭 Design Principles

The framework was designed with long-term maintainability and CI reliability in mind.

Core principles include:

**Test Independence**  
      Tests run safely in any order, enabling deterministic parallel execution.

**Separation of Concerns**  
      Test logic, page interactions, configuration, and utilities are clearly separated.

**Maintainable Locators**  
      All UI locators live inside Page Objects to reduce duplication and simplify updates.

**Reusable Components**  
      Shared behaviors such as authentication, configuration loading, and test data management are abstracted into reusable utilities.

**CI-First Execution**  
      Tests are designed for reliable CI execution through headless mode, failure observability, and deterministic state management.

# 📊 Test Strategy

The framework follows a layered testing strategy to balance speed, reliability, and coverage.

| Layer                 | Purpose                                   | Tooling       |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------|
| API Tests             | Validate backend behavior and contracts   | RestAssured   |
| UI Tests (Playwright) | Fast modern browser automation            | Playwright    |
| UI Tests (Selenium)   | Cross-browser compatibility validation    | Selenium      |

Playwright provides fast modern browser automation while Selenium is retained for cross-browser validation and legacy ecosystem compatibility.

## Testing Pyramid

           E2E UI Tests
        -------------------
        Integration Tests
     -------------------------
        API / Service Tests
   -----------------------------
           Unit Tests

## Execution Strategy

**Smoke Tests**
  - Run on every pull request
  - Validate critical user flows

**Regression Tests**
  - Run on scheduled builds or full CI runs
  - Provide broader coverage of functionality

This layered approach helps detect failures earlier in the testing pyramid while still validating full user workflows.

# 📊 Execution Metrics

Execution times measured locally (parallel enabled):


| Suite Type | Command                        | Tests | Execution Time |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ | ----- | -------------- |
| Smoke      | `mvn test -Dgroups=smoke`      | 10    | ~66 seconds    |
| Regression | `mvn test -Dgroups=regression` | 34    | ~2 minutes 22s |
| API Only   | `mvn test -Dgroups=api`        | 12    | ~12 seconds    |
| UI Only    | `mvn test -Dgroups=ui`         | 34    | ~4 minutes 6s  |

# 🔄 Browser Lifecycle Management

```text
@BeforeAll   → Launch Playwright
@BeforeEach  → Create BrowserContext
@BeforeEach  → Create Page
@Test        → Execute Test Logic
@AfterEach   → Capture Screenshot on Failure
@AfterEach   → Close Context
@AfterAll    → Close Browser
```

Key design decisions:

* Context-per-test isolation
* Screenshot capture via TestExecutionExceptionHandler
* Cleanup guaranteed even during failure
* No cross-test contamination

# ⚡ Parallel Execution Strategy

The framework is designed for safe parallel execution.

## How it works:

* New `BrowserContext per test`
* No static Page objects
* No shared test state
* Deterministic test data
* Isolated teardown logic

Parallel execution is configured via:

```text
junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.enabled=true
```
Benefits:
* Faster feedback cycles
* Reliable CI execution
* Order-independent tests
* Enterprise scalability

# 🧪 Current Automated Coverage

## 🔐Authentication Suite

* ✅ Successful login
* ✅ Invalid username
* ✅ Invalid password
* ✅ Required field validation
* ✅ Negative authentication scenarios

Designed to validate:

* UI state transitions
* Error messaging
* Input validation
* Access control behavior

# 📸 Failure Observability Strategy

To improve CI debuggability:

* Screenshot captured at failure point
* Uses TestExecutionExceptionHandler (not TestWatcher)
* Avoids lifecycle timing issues
* Failure artifacts available in CI logs

Result: Deterministic, observable, and debuggable automation.

# 🛠 Flakiness Mitigation Strategy

UI automation fails when synchronization is weak. This framework prevents flakiness by:

* Leveraging Playwright’s built-in auto-waiting
* Avoiding `Thread.sleep()`
* Using semantic, label-based locators
* Avoiding `nth()` selectors
* Context isolation per test
* Deterministic test data generation
* Explicit state-based assertions

Result: Stable, repeatable CI execution.

# ▶️ Running Tests Locally

## 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```text
git clone https://github.com/chukwuma1976/sdet-enterprise-automation-framework.git
cd sdet-enterprise-automation-framework
```
## 2️⃣ Execute Tests
```text
mvn clean test
```
## 3️⃣ Debug Mode (Headed Browser)
Set in `config.properties`:
```text
headless=false
```

# 🚦 Smoke vs Regression Strategy

The framework uses JUnit 5 tags to control test scope.

## Smoke Tests
Smoke tests validate critical user journeys and run on every CI pipeline execution.

Typical coverage:

* Login
* Core navigation
* Critical CRUD flows
* Basic API health checks

Execution time target:
```text
< 1 minute

```
# Regression Suite

Regression tests validate **broader system functionality** including:

* edge cases
* validation rules
* negative scenarios
* full UI/API coverage

Regression suites are typically executed:

* nightly
* before release
* during extended pipeline validation

# 🔁 Retry Strategy Explanation

Automation reliability requires distinguishing between:

* **legitimate product defects**
* **environmental flakiness**

This framework intentionally avoids automatic blind retries in the test code.

Instead it emphasizes:

* deterministic test design
* Playwright auto-wait synchronization
* stable locators
* context isolation

Retries may be introduced at the **CI pipeline** layer if needed.

This ensures test failures remain **actionable signals rather than hidden noise.**

# 📸 Screenshot-on-Failure Strategy

When UI tests fail in CI environments, diagnosing issues without visual artifacts becomes difficult.

This framework implements **automatic screenshot capture at the moment of failure.**

Implementation approach:

* Uses **JUnit 5 TestExecutionExceptionHandler**
* Captures screenshot **before browser teardown**
* Avoids lifecycle timing issues caused by TestWatcher

Lifecycle flow:
```
Test Failure
      ↓
Exception Intercepted
      ↓
Screenshot Captured
      ↓
Failure Propagated
```

Benefits:

* Faster debugging
* Clear CI diagnostics
* Reduced time investigating failures

# 🏷 Running Tagged Suites

Tests are organized using **JUnit 5 tags.**

## Test Suites

The framework uses JUnit `@Tag` annotations to organize tests into logical suites.  
These tags allow selective execution of tests for different purposes such as smoke testing, regression testing, UI testing, or API validation.

| Suite Name      | Tag                   |
|-----------------|-----------------------|
| smoke           | `@Tag("smoke")`       |
| regression      | `@Tag("regression")`  |
| ui              | `@Tag("ui")`          |
| api             | `@Tag("api")`         |
| playwright      | `@Tag("playwright")`  |
| selenium        | `@Tag("selenium")`    |

### Example

```java
@Tag("smoke")
@Tag("ui")
@Test
void userCanLogin() {
    // test implementation
}
```

Run only smoke tests:
```text
mvn test -Dgroups=smoke
```
Run regression suite:
```text
mvn test -Dgroups=regression
```
Run API tests only:
```text
mvn test -Dgroups=api
```
Run UI tests only:
```text
mvn test -Dgroups=ui
```
Run a specific test class:
```text
mvn -Dtest=ClassName test
```

# 🖥 Headed vs Headless Execution

The framework supports both **headed (local debugging)** and **headless (CI execution)** modes.

## Headed Mode
Used during local debugging.
```text
headless=false
```
Benefits:

* Visual debugging
* Step-by-step test observation
* Development troubleshooting

## Headless Mode
Used in CI environments.
```text
headless=true
```
Benefits:

* Faster execution
* Reduced resource usage
* CI pipeline compatibility

CI pipelines always execute in headless mode.

# ⚙️ Configuration Management

* Centralized `ConfigReader`
* `config.properties`
* Environment variable override support
* Designed for multi-environment execution (dev / staging / prod)
* CI-friendly configuration injection
